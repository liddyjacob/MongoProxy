# Mongo Proxy 

This project launches a proxy server that any mongo client can connect to. The instructions are pretty simple:

Step 1: Make sure mongo is installed and running on your device on port 27017

Step 2: Install all needed python packages

Step 3: Launch the python server: `python3 mongo_proxy.py`

Step 4: Connect to the server locally with the mongo shell: mongo --port=65432
